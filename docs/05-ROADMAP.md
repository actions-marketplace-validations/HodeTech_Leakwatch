| Existing tools evolve rapidly | Medium | Medium | Focus on differentiation (MIT + verification combo) |
| Solo developer burnout | High | High | Small phase-based goals, encourage community contributions |
| API verification rate limiting | Medium | Low | Smart rate limiting, caching, `--no-verify` option |
