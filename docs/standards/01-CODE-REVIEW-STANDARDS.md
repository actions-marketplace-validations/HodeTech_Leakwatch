# Leakwatch - Code Review Standards

> **Document Version:** 1.0
> **Date:** 2026-03-24
> **Status:** Draft

---

## 1. Purpose and Scope

Code reviews are the quality gate for code entering the `main` branch. Every pull request must be reviewed by at least one developer before merging. This document defines the review process, checklists, finding classification, and review output format.

Since Leakwatch is a **security tool**, code reviews include additional checks focused on security, performance, and concurrency beyond standard software quality.

---

## 2. Review Principles

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Standards-Focused** | Every finding should reference a documented standard, not personal preference |
| **Severity Accuracy** | Findings are classified by impact, not by effort to fix |
| **Actionable** | Every finding includes a concrete fix suggestion or direction |
| **No False Positives** | Every finding must be verified against the actual code |
| **Regression Awareness** | Fix commits should be evaluated as potential sources of new bugs |
| **Completeness** | All changed files must be reviewed |

---

## 3. Finding Classification

### 3.1 Severity Levels

| Level | Label | Merge | Description |
|-------|-------|-------|-------------|
| **CRITICAL** | `🔴 CRITICAL` | Blocks | Security vulnerability, data loss risk, secret leakage |
| **MAJOR** | `🟠 MAJOR` | Blocks | Architecture violation, bug, missing tests |
| **MINOR** | `🟡 MINOR` | Does not block | Style, naming, minor improvements |
| **SUGGESTION** | `🔵 SUGGESTION` | Does not block | Alternative approach, future improvement |

### 3.2 Zero Tolerance Rules (Always CRITICAL)

When the following conditions are detected, the finding is **always classified as CRITICAL**:

| # | Rule | Reference |
|---|------|-----------|
| ZT-01 | Logging, printing to console, or saving discovered secret content to disk | CLAUDE.md, Security Principles |
| ZT-02 | Using real secret content in test fixtures | CLAUDE.md |
| ZT-03 | Adding a dependency that requires CGO | ADR-0001 |
| ZT-04 | Business logic inside the `cmd/` package | CLAUDE.md, Package Rules |
| ZT-05 | Making architectural decisions that contradict ADRs | CLAUDE.md |
| ZT-06 | Using `fmt.Println` or `log.Printf` (instead of `log/slog`) | 04-DEVELOPMENT-STANDARDS §2.5 |
| ZT-07 | Race condition: unsynchronized access to shared state | Go Concurrency |
| ZT-08 | Goroutine leak: unclosed channel or uncancelled context | ADR-0008 |
| ZT-09 | Error swallowing: silently continuing in `if err != nil` block | 04-DEVELOPMENT-STANDARDS §2.4 |
| ZT-10 | Manually editing `go.sum` or `vendor/` directory | CLAUDE.md |
| ZT-11 | Skipping git hooks with `--no-verify` | CLAUDE.md |
| ZT-12 | Using ASCII art diagrams (instead of Mermaid) | 00-DOCUMENTATION-STANDARDS |

## 4. Review Checklist

### 4.1 Security (SEC)

Since Leakwatch is a security tool, this section has the **highest priority**.

| # | Check | Severity |
|---|-------|----------|
| SEC-01 | Is discovered secret data masked via the `Redacted` field? Is `Raw` content never logged? | CRITICAL |
| SEC-02 | Do verification API calls use only read-only endpoints? (e.g., STS GetCallerIdentity) | CRITICAL |
| SEC-03 | Are user inputs (file paths, URLs, regex patterns) validated? | MAJOR |
| SEC-04 | Is path traversal protection in place? (`filepath.Clean`, `filepath.Rel`) | MAJOR |
| SEC-05 | Are regex patterns safe against ReDoS? (Go's RE2 engine guarantee is sufficient, but performance should be checked for complex patterns) | MAJOR |
| SEC-06 | Is the newly added dependency trustworthy? Is its license MIT/Apache/BSD compatible? | MAJOR |
| SEC-07 | Is secret content hidden from output without the `--show-raw` flag? | CRITICAL |

| ARCH-06 | Are there circular dependencies? | CRITICAL |
| ARCH-07 | If a new architectural decision is being made, has an ADR been written? | MAJOR |
| ARCH-08 | Has the standard library been preferred? Have unnecessary dependencies been avoided? | MINOR |

### 4.5 Testing (TEST)

| # | Check | Severity |
|---|-------|----------|
| TEST-01 | Have tests been written for new code? | MAJOR |
| TEST-02 | Is the table-driven test pattern used? | MINOR |
| TEST-03 | Does test naming follow the `Test<Function>_<Scenario>_<ExpectedResult>` format? | MINOR |
| TEST-04 | Are edge cases tested? (empty input, nil, large data, context cancellation) | MAJOR |
| TEST-05 | Are mocks written against interfaces? | MINOR |
| TEST-06 | Do detector tests use format patterns, not real secret content? | CRITICAL |
| TEST-07 | Is `fstest.MapFS` preferred for in-memory filesystem tests? | SUGGESTION |
| TEST-08 | Are test coverage targets met? (detectors 95%, engine 85%, overall 80%) | MAJOR |

### 4.8 Detector-Specific Checks (DET)

| # | Check | Severity |
|---|-------|----------|
| DET-01 | Is the regex compiled once at package level with `regexp.MustCompile`? (not inside `Scan()`) | MAJOR |

## 8. Review Priority Order

Follow this priority order during review:

```
1. Security (SEC)           ← Highest priority
2. Zero Tolerance (ZT)
3. Concurrency (CONC)
4. Architecture (ARCH)
5. Error Handling (ERR)
6. Testing (TEST)

## 9. Common Anti-Patterns

### 9.1 Go Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Correct Approach |
|--------------|------------------|
| `go func() { ... }()` without context | `go func(ctx context.Context) { ... }(ctx)` |
| `select {}` for infinite wait | `select { case <-ctx.Done(): return }` |
| `sync.Mutex` where `sync.RWMutex` is needed | Use `RWMutex` for read-heavy access |
| Blocking risk on channel send | Buffered channel or `select` with timeout |
| `regexp.Compile` on every call | Package-level `regexp.MustCompile` |
| Error swallowing in `err != nil` check | Always `return fmt.Errorf("context: %w", err)` |
| `log.Fatal` in production code | `slog.Error` + appropriate exit code |
| Unnecessary use of `interface{}` or `any` | Concrete type or generic |

### 9.2 Detector Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Correct Approach |
|--------------|------------------|
| Compiling regex inside `Scan()` | Package-level `var re = regexp.MustCompile(...)` |
| Returning `Raw` field without masking | Always populate the `Redacted` field |
| Overly broad regex (false positives) | More specific pattern + entropy check |
| Detector without keywords (regex on every chunk) | Proper `Keywords()` for Aho-Corasick filtering |
| Using real API keys in tests | Format pattern + random characters |
